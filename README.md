# BrightDreams
Full Site: https://brightdreams.netlify.app/ .
A landing page for a fictitious company with responsive design and animations. Uses html, css, sass/scss, js, animate on scroll library with google fonts and fontawesome.

# What I Learned
I learned a lot about image positioning and placement and further developed my understanding of flex with this project. I discovered the animate-on-scroll library and learned that while there are some really cool animations in this library, less is sometimes more. I overwhlemed my website (and portfolio) with animations from this library but eventually decided to remove them which led to a better feel of the website. 

This was a mobile first design which is very different than what I'm used to, I usually do desktop first. However, I was able to understand the benefits in mobile first design as it led to less media queries needed in the end.
